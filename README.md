# ♻️ Waste Detection using YOLOv5

This project implements an object detection system to identify and classify different types of waste (e.g., plastic, paper, metal, organic) using the YOLOv5 deep learning model. It is designed to support automated waste segregation and recycling efforts in smart cities and environmental systems.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Just clone it and try it out:

bash
git clone https://github.com/saibalaji-21/Waste-Detection-using-YOLOv5.git
cd Waste-Detection-using-YOLOv5

## 📌 Project Goals

- Detect waste materials in real-time from images or videos.
- Classify waste into predefined categories for better disposal or recycling.
- Support integration with IoT devices like smart bins or sorting robots.
